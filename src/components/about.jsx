          I solve problems in ways that are understandable. At Amity University,
          where I am completing my junior year in the College of Engineering. I
          learned how to solve modern-day problems with basic strategies.
          *concentrate on web development and software development, databases.
          *currently learning React and hope will complete in next few months.
          *Also interested in business prospects and modern-day solutions. I
          hope to complete my skills and get real-life experience and important
          technical skills. I am not at my finest quality but strive for one
          someday.
